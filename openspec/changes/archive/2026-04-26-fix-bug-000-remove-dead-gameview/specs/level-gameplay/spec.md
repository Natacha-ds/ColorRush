## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Single canonical level-gameplay view

The application SHALL render any level-based game session exclusively through the `LevelGameView` view. No other game view (legacy or alternative) shall coexist in the compiled `ColorGame` target.

#### Scenario: Starting a game from the selection screen

- **WHEN** the player picks a mode and difficulty in `LevelSystemSelectionView` and taps "Start"
- **THEN** the game session opens in an instance of `LevelGameView` (and no other game view)

#### Scenario: Source code audit

- **WHEN** a developer searches the `ColorGame` target for game-view definitions
- **THEN** only `LevelGameView` is defined; no legacy `struct GameView: View` remains in the module
